                    <p>… well it certainly wasn't what I expected, but that's not a bad thing. The zoo area itself is quite an expansive area so you have to come prepared to do a lot of walking, it took us about 3 hours to see everything, and that was without having a rest break of any sort.</p>

                    <p>… as a teacher I'm constantly looking for new experiences to help reinforce what I teach to the kids in class. Obviously coming out here as part of a field trip helps, but it would also be good to be able to get back to our small little primary school and review with the kids what we have heard, seen, and learnt here.</p>

                    <p>… I think my grandmother is feeling pretty freaked out about the whole thing. We didn't realise just how huge that tank of a Rhino really was. Perhaps if we had known some things about it before hand we would not have taken that particular route through the zoo.</p>
