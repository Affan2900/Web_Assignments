                    <h3>Rex the Rhino</h3>
                    <p>Rex, our resident rhinoceros, is a true marvel of nature. As a member of the "Big Five" game animals, Rex represents power, resilience, and the importance of conservation. Rhinoceroses like Rex can weigh up to 2,000 kg (4,400 lb) and run at speeds of up to 55 km/h (34 mph), despite their bulky appearance. Their thick skin, which can be up to 5 cm (2 inches) thick, serves as natural armor.</p>
                    <p>Rex's most distinctive feature is his horn, which is made of keratin - the same protein that forms human hair and nails. This horn continues to grow throughout his life and can reach lengths of up to 1.5 meters (5 feet)! Despite their intimidating size, rhinos like Rex are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses, leaves, and fruits. They play a crucial role in their ecosystems by helping to shape the landscape through their feeding habits.</p>

                    <h3>Kai the Kiwi</h3>
                    <p>Kai, our charming kiwi, is a rare and fascinating bird native to New Zealand. Despite being about the size of a domestic chicken, kiwis are related to ostriches and emus. Kai is nocturnal and flightless, with tiny wings that are barely visible. His long, flexible beak is perfect for sniffing out insects and worms in the soil.</p>
                    <p>Kiwis like Kai have some unique features among birds: they have marrow in their bones (most birds have hollow bones), and their nostrils are located at the tip of their beaks rather than at the base. Kai's feathers are more like soft fur, providing excellent camouflage in his forest habitat. As a symbol of New Zealand's natural heritage, Kai plays an important role in our conservation education programs.</p>

                    <h3>JoJo the Giraffe</h3>
                    <p>JoJo, our towering giraffe, is one of the most recognizable animals in our zoo. Standing at an impressive height of up to 5.5 meters (18 feet), JoJo offers visitors a unique perspective on the world of African wildlife. Giraffes like JoJo are the tallest land animals on Earth, with their long necks allowing them to reach leaves and buds in treetops that other herbivores can't access.</p>
                    <p>One of JoJo's most fascinating features is his heart, which can be up to 60 cm (2 feet) long and weigh up to 12 kg (26 pounds). This powerful organ is necessary to pump blood all the way up that long neck to JoJo's brain. Despite their size, giraffes are known for their grace and can run at speeds of up to 60 km/h (37 mph). JoJo's distinctive coat pattern is not just for show - it helps with camouflage and temperature regulation in the African savanna.</p>
